# Y86RackYourBrain

## Description

The Y86Rackyourbrain is an app that allows users to learn Y86 assembly code by manually executing the instructions and checking its accuracy using a virtual machine. The app has a range of features that make it user-friendly and informative.

In this project, I implemented a parser for Y86 instructions and a virtual machine that executes the instructions. The purpose of this project is to experiment with Swift (learned in 1 week) and review my knowledge of object-oriented programming and computer architecture.
