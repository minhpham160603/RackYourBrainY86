# Swift-Student-Challenge-2023

## Description

The Y86Rackyourbrain is an app that allows users to learn Y86 assembly code by manually executing the instruction and checking its accuracy using a virtual machine. The app has a range of features that make it both user-friendly and informative.

The app uniquely includes a game, which contains a virtual machine, a userâ€™s register board, a condition code board, and a memory board. At each step, users manually set the values of registers, memory tables, and condition codes, to match with the virtual machine. This helps them to better understand the Y86 code and provides them with a more immersive and interactive learning experience.

The app also includes documentation on Y86 assembly language and fundamentals of computer architecture. The app provides users with manuals and documents that give them all the information they need to understand and execute complex assembly code. 

The app has been developed using Swift programming language and SwiftUI for the GUI. The virtual machine used in the app has been developed using object-oriented programming.

The app includes three different versions, each with varying levels of complexity. This feature ensures that users of all skill levels can enjoy the app and improve their coding/debugging skills. The varying levels of complexity also ensure that users are continually challenged and motivated to improve their coding/debugging ability.

In summary, the Y86Rackyourbrain is an app that provides users with a fun and immersive learning experience. With its comprehensive documentation, virtual machine, and game-like learning style, the app is ideal for anyone interested in learning or improving their skills in assembly language.
